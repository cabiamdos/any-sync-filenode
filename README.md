# Any-Sync File Node
Implementation of file node from [`any-sync`](https://github.com/anyproto/any-sync) protocol.

## Building the source
To ensure compatibility, please use Go version `1.22`.

To build and run the Any-Sync File Node on your own server, follow these technical steps:

1.  Clone the Any-Sync File Node repository to your local machine.
2.  Navigate to the root directory of the repository, where you will find a `Makefile`.
3.  Run the following commands to install the required dependencies and build the Any-Sync File Node.
    ```
    make deps
    make build
    ```
4.  If there are no errors, the Any-Sync File Node will be built and can be found in the `/bin` directory.

## Running
You will need an S3-compatible object storage and Redis to run Any-Sync File Node. Note that credentials are necessary to make requests to S3. For more information, refer to the [`aws-sdk-go` documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go#readme-configuring-credentials).

Any-Sync File Node requires a configuration. You can generate configuration files for your nodes with [`any-sync-network`](https://github.com/anyproto/any-sync-tools) tool.

The following options are available for running the Any-Sync File Node:

 - `-c` ‚Äî path to config file (default `etc/any-sync-filenode.yml`). 
 - `-v` ‚Äî current version.
 - `-h` ‚Äî help message.
